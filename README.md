<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game</h1>

## brief
Code a game of rock paper scissors.


## Task:
    ```
     Instructions
     take in a number 0-2 from the user that represents their hand
     generate a random number 0-2 to use for the computer's hand
     call the function get_hand to get the string representation of the user's hand
     call the function get_hand to get the string representation of the computer's hand
     call the function determine_winner to figure out who won
     print out the player hand and computer hand
     print out the winner
     Some Tips
     Creating a function that gets a "hand" based on a number.

     The function should take in a number and return the string representation of the hand. E.g.:

    def get_hand(hand):
         # 0 = scissor, 1 = rock, 2 = paper

        # for example if the variable hand is 0, it should return the string "scissor"
        pass
    ```
